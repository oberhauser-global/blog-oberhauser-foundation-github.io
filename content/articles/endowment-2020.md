**Year 2020 Update** &mdash; This article outlines the targeted capital distribution and endowment
structure of 2020. For information about the distribution of grants in 2020 see article
[Grants 2020](/articles/grants-2020/).

The legal structure of the _Oberhauser Foundation_ as of the writing of this
article imposes no constraints on capital distributions. That allows a
greater flexibility and results in overall lower management costs. That said,
the endowment and the resulting grant distribution structure is setup in
such a way to be sustainable over the long run and at the same time to
maximize the impact that grants have.

## Endowment Structure

The investment of the endowment follows rather moderate and low-cost investment
strategy, given the long investment horizon. Half of the capital, 50%,
is invested in the overall U.S. Stock Market and the other half, 50%,
is invested in the total U.S. Bond Market.

## Targeted Capital Distribution

The foundation distributes _Grants_ over the year to selected charities.
The _Principal_ is the endowment of the consecutive year. It includes
the remaining contributions, capital gains, interests and dividends.
The _Expense Ratio_ is the administrative overhead. It targets a
5% yearly grant payout to increase the longevity of the fund.
