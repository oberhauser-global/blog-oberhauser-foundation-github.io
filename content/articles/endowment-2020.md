**Year 2020 Update** &mdash; This article outlines the targeted capital distribution and endowment
structure of 2020. It does not go into details to which charities
or categories of charities the grants are distributed too. That is left
for another article.

The legal structure of the _Oberhauser Foundation_ as of the writing of this
article imposes no constraints on capital distributions. That allows a
greater flexibility and results in lower overall costs of the management
of the foundation. That said, the endowment and the resulting grant
distribution structure is setup in such a way to be sustainable over
the long run.

## Endowment Structure

The investment of the endowment follows rather moderate and low-cost investment
strategy, given the long investment horizon. Half of the capital, 50%,
is invested in the overall U.S. Stock Market and the other half, 50%,
is invested in the total U.S. Bond Market.

## Targeted Capital Distribution

The foundation distributes _Grants_ over the year to selected charities.
The _Principal_ is the endowment of the consecutive year. It includes
the remaining contributions, capital gains, interests and dividends.
The _Expense Ratio_ is the administrative overhead. It targets a
5% yearly grant payout rate to increase the longevity of the fund.
