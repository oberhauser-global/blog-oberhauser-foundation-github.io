**Boston, Massachusetts USA** &mdash; June 29th, 2020 &mdash; The _Oberhauser Foundation_
was established under the charter of the _Oberhauser Dynasty_ in the midst of the global
COVID-19 pandemic and a global economical crisis.

The main directive of the foundation is to manage the endowment for charitable giving
and to align the yearly issued grants with the values of the donors and the mission
of the _Oberhauser Dynasty_.

The created structures facilitate sustainable giving that can be carried on by future
generations. By pooling resources, grants can be directed in a more efficient and
targeted way.
