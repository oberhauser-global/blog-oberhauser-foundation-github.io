## Minority Rights &mdash; 25%

Given the social unrest, especially in the U.S. and in the context of police brutality
and other systematic issues in the U.S. and around the world, we strongly believe that
things need to change. By supporting causes where everyone is equal we create a society
for our kids and grandkids that is inclusive and fair, no matter who they are.

Minority rights are dear to our heart and will stay so long after the main stream media
moved on to other issues.

## Cancer Research &mdash; 25%

Cancer is a long standing medical problem that is getting more serious as older
societies get. Given that nearly everyone knows someone that was affected by cancer or was
affected directly, we want to assure that cancer research is not forgotten.

## Medical Specialty Research &mdash; 25%

Without going into much detail it is safe to say that there are more illnesses that
are affecting us as species. Under the category _Medical Specialty Research_ we
support all the medical causes that are dear to our heart. Either because someone
close is affected and/or if we see the need for support for medical issues that
are systemic or pandemic.

## Education &amp; Entrepreneurship &mdash; 25%

Economical empowerment is only possible if people have access to high quality education
with a strong entrepreneurial drive to applied the learned knowledge. Not everyone is
in this fortunate position as we have been and are.
