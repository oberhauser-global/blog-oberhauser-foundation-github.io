For obvious reasons only categories and percentages are shared. The article gives
also insight into why these categories have been selected.</p>
<p>The council determined the following grant distribution for the year 2020. All these causes
are personal and very dear to our heart. The support is not based on short term media coverage,
but on the goal to systematically create a better future for our kids and grandkids.</p>
<p><img src="/images/grant-distribution-2020.svg" alt="Grant Distribution 2020"></p>
<h2 id="25-mdash-minority-rights">25% — Minority Rights</h2>
<p>Given the social unrest, especially in the U.S. and in the context of increased police brutality against
colored communities and other systematic race issues around the world, we strongly believe that things need
to change.</p>
<h2 id="25-mdash-education-amp-entrepreneurship">25% — Education &amp; Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>Economical empowerment is only possible if people have access to high quality education
with a strong entrepreneurial drive to applied the learned knowledge. Not everyone is
in this fortunate position as we have been and are.</p>
<h2 id="25-mdash-cancer-research">25% — Cancer Research</h2>
<p>Cancer is a long standing medical problem that is getting more serious as older
societies get. Given that nearly everyone knows someone that was affected by cancer or was
affected directly, we want to assure that cancer research is not forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="25-mdash-medical-specialty-research">25% — Medical Specialty Research</h2>
<p>Without going into much detail it is safe to say that there are more illnesses that
are affecting us as species. Under the category <em>Medical Specialty Research</em> we
support all the medical causes that are dear to our heart. Either because someone
close is affected and/or we see a need for support for medical issues that
are systemic or pandemic.</p><ul class="pa0">
